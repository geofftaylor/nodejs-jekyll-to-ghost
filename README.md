Node.js Jekyll to Ghost
======================
An update to weblancaster's [nodejs-jekyll-to-ghost](https://github.com/weblancaster/nodejs-jekyll-to-ghost).

### Updates
1. The deprecated `node-uuid` module has been replaced with `uuid`.
2. The `markdown` module has been replaced with `markdown-it`.
3. HTML tags are allowed in the Markdown source.
4. Liquid tags are removed from the Markdown source prior to converting it to HTML.
5. The generated HTML is wrapped in an `html` card and converted to [modiledoc](https://ghost.org/docs/api/v3/migration/content/#mobiledoc).
6. Jekyll tags are converted to Ghost tags.

---

This NodeJS module will help you to export [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) markdown posts to a format that can be easily imported to [Ghost Blog Platform](http://ghost.org). <br>
It doesn't handle static pages, and it doesn't do anything with images. You'll have to copy those over yourself and manually adjust any URL differences.

This was built by reverse-engineering the version of [Wordpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ghost/) and  [Ghost schema](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/data/schema.js) to match the JSON file it outputs.


### Prerequisite

- Node.js v4.0

### How to use

Clone/download the repository then place your Jekyll posts into `posts` folder or create a folder in the root level with your Jekyll posts.
Your post should be on YAML format (which is Jekyll default format).

To install dependencies

```ruby
sudo npm install
```

To start to export

```ruby
node index.js ./path/to/jekyll/posts
```

Type the name of the folder.. wait for the magic happen.
If everything went fine you should get this message

`Ghost JSON generated successfully!`

And a file called `ghost-generated.json` was created on your folder.

After do the steps above boot up your Ghost platform.

```ruby
npm start
```

Go to the url `http://localhost:2368/ghost/debug/` import the file generated nodejs-jekyll-to-ghost called `ghost-generated.json`
That's it.. Now you should have migrated your posts to Ghost format and ready to begin blog on your new Ghost blog platform.

ps: I removed all test posts on Ghost blog before migrate my Ghost generated format.
